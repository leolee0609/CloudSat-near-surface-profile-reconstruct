# CloudSat-near-surface-profile-reconstruct
A research project developing a Transformer-based model to reconstruct global near-surface hydrometeor profiles in CloudSat mission's blind zone. The model follows a pre-training fine-tune approach for transfer learning to overcome the domain shift along the horizontal and vertical dimensions while "flying".
